HIMANI-MAKEUP STUDIO
I'M USING THIS FILE AS A NOTE IN THIS PROJECT, WILL FINALISE THE README ONCE THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED.
I FUCKING LOVE BACKEND.
BACKEND:
users can book a slot
users can buy a product (makeup products)
payment integration to buy the products
Form validation with zod
automated email to both user and admin upon successful booking

HOW DO I CREATE THE ADMIN PANEL?
Do the admin need authentication? yeah i think so! cause anyone would be able to manipulate the users data if the admin is not fixed. But how do i fix the admin? limit them to only one user? or what man. will think about it.
Admin can CRUD the ecom products in the page, use multer to upload product image
Admin can see the users data base

PROJECT-WORLFLOW:
[29-06-2025]
create form, validate with zod, send email to user and the admin using nodemailer, maybe verify the phone number or email with otp.
Admin can see the booking details in the page, daily weekly and monthly database. decide more about admin panel!?
